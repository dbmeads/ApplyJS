ApplyJS is in its earliest stages so don't expect any miracles yet.

Feel free to add issues for any features you would like to see or bugs you find and I'll do my best to get them resolved in a timely manner.

Current Priorities:

- Handling ajax error scenarios
- Make views proper promise objects
- Super references
- View delegation
- Minified version
- Travis CI
- Code Coverage
- Benchmarking (benchmark.js)
- Example apps (TodoMVC)
